            <h2>Step 2: Picking a Gym</h2>
            <p>The first step in any journey is making a plan. Fitness is no different, and once the plan is made you have to commit to it to see results. So lets answer some questions to determine our approach:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Would you like to lose or gain weight?</li>
                <li>Do you want to add more activity in your life?</li>
                <li>How many days can you go to the gym per week?</li>
                <li>What is your monthly budget?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each of these questions are important for figuring out what the basic structure of your routine will look like. Remember your answers as they will be referenced in Step 2!</p>
